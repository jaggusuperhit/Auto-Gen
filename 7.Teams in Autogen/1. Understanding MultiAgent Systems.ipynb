A catastrophic experiment cost him his left arm and led him down a path of ruin, turning towards the arcane to sate his thirst for power. Exiled from the scientific community, he delved deeper into the mystic arts, fueled by an insatiable desire to command the unseen forces of darkness.\\n\\n**Motivation:** Dr. Myrkur aims to plunge the world into eternal twilight, believing that only by cloaking the world in shadows can he truly master his craft and transcend his own humanity.
